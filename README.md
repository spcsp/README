## StrokesPlus.net ClearScript Plugins

[StrokesPlus.net](https://www.strokesplus.net/) is an amazing piece of software that can automate most parts of windows. Included with the support for gestures and hotkeys, is ClearScript. Many useful functions are provided, as well as the core of .NET

With some tinkering, we have leveraged [npmjs](https://npmjs.org) and the `npm` package manager to create a plugin ecosystem. The program also offers support for C# plugins, which is fantastic (official plugin soon?)
